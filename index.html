    <p>Hello! I'm Natalie Davidson, a PhD student affiliated with <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/" target="_blank">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>. I am currently obtaining my Ph.D from <a href="http://compbio.triiprograms.org" target="_blank">Tri-Institutional Program for Computational Biology and Medicine</a> in New York, while conducting research at <a href="http://ethz.ch" target="_blank">ETH ZÃ¼rich</a>.</p>

    <p>I am interested in understanding the role transcriptional dysregulation plays in cancer. Through my collaborations during my Ph.D., I have been able to conduct single cancer and pan-cancer analyses using RNA-Seq and Ribosome Profiling data. I typically use generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models, but I am interested in extending to other models as the numbers of samples in cancer analyses grow. I am currently a part of the <a href="http://icgc.org" target="_blank">International Cancer Genome Consortium</a>, where I integrate multiple transcriptional aberrations such as splicing, fusions, over/under expression, allele specific expression, and others in over 1,000 samples to identify cancer relevant genes and alteration patterns.

    <p>
      I received my B.Sc. in computer science and minor in mathematics from University of California, Santa Barbara. &nbsp;I received my M.Sc. in computer science from <a href="http://ucla.edu" target="_blank">University of California, Los Angeles</a> under the advisement of <a href="http://www.biolchem.ucla.edu/labs/ernst/" target="_blank">Dr. Jason Ernst</a>.
