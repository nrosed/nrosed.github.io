 - title: "Integrating Diverse Transcriptomic Alterations to Identify Cancer-Relevant Genes"

   desc:
    In this project, we performed a comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic alterations across 27 cancer types. We increased the number of samples found to contain an alteration in cancer relevant pathways, and identified cancer relevant genes through a recurrence analysis using both DNA- and RNA-level aberrations.

 - title: "Identification and Characterization of HIF-Dependent Altenative Splicing Events in Pancreatic Cancer"

   desc:
      Hypoxia is prevalent in many tumors and associated with malignant tumor progression. Hypoxia mediates its effects primarily through hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), a family of heterodimeric transcription factors composed of distinct HIF1a and a shared HIF1ß subunit. While the effects of HIFs on transcription programs have been extensively studied in the past, little is known about splicing. To determine such roles, we performed RNA-seq on human pancreatic cancer (PDAC) cells subjected to hypoxia in the absence or presence of HIF1ß to define the HIF-dependency of any effects.

    <p>Hello! I'm Natalie Davidson, a PhD student affiliated with <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>. I am currently obtaining my Ph.D from <a href="http://compbio.triiprograms.org" target="_blank">Tri-Institutional Program for Computational Biology and Medicine</a> in New York, while conducting research at <a href="http://ethz.ch" target="_blank">ETH Zürich</a>.</p>

    <p>I am interested in understanding the role transcriptional dysregulation plays in cancer. Through my collaborations during my Ph.D., I have been able to conduct single cancer and pan-cancer analyses using RNA-Seq and Ribosome Profiling data. I typically use generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models, but I am interested in extending to other models as the numbers of samples in cancer analyses grow. I am currently a part of the <a href="http://icgc.org" target="_blank">International Cancer Genome Consortium</a>, where I integrate multiple transcriptional aberrations such as splicing, fusions, over/under expression, allele specific expression, and others in over 1,000 samples to identify cancer relevant genes and alteration patterns. I received my B.Sc. in computer science and minor in mathematics from University of California, Santa Barbara. &nbsp;I received my M.Sc. in computer science from <a href="http://ucla.edu" target="_blank">University of California, Los Angeles</a> under the advisement of <a href="http://www.biolchem.ucla.edu/labs/ernst/" target="_blank">Dr. Jason Ernst</a>.

    <p>
      <b>Research Focus:</b> extending statistical models to gain deeper understanding of transcriptional dysregulation in cancer.
